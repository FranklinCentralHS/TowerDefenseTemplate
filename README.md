# TowerDefenseTemplate
 Some changes I made in the project are adding towers. The towers dont kill the enemies. The project though overall did not go well. The towers wouldn't kill the enemies and the game crashed when players exited the game. But I did get enemies to move in a path and a functioning UI.
